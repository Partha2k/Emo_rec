# Facial-Emotion-Detection
This work showcases two independent methods for recognizing emotions from faces. The first method using representational autoencoder units, a fairly original idea, to classify an image among one of the seven different emotions. The second method uses a 8-layer convolutional neural network which has an original and unique design, and was developed from scratch. The models were trained on the JAFFE dataset, and we tested on a seperate JAFFE test set and a subjectively labeled Labeled Faces in the Wild data set.
